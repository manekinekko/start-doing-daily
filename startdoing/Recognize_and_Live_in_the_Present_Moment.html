                        <p>Time, or our awareness of time rather, is one of the strongest influencers of just about every aspect of life.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Each day we spend much of our waking hours thinking about both the past and future. And very little about what's going on in the present moment.
                        </br>
                        </br>        
                        Our minds are constantly retreiving and constructing a better understanding (sense) of the world through experiences - lessons learned from both success and failure. Foresight then leverages those memories to drive our judgements and decisions of the future. 
                        </br>     
                        </br>    
                        And I think we'd all agree that we want our past (or what we remember of it) to consist of pleasurable experiences rather than painful. And we expect our future to be bright and full of hope.
                        </br>
                        </br>      
                        However, in assuring ourselves of only good memories and expectations, we tend to put up with a terrible present. We hang on to jobs and relationships well beyond the time we should.  
                        </br>
                        </br>     
                            When we don’t have that assurance, we find oursleves unhappy or even miserable even in the midst of pleasure.
                        </br>
                        </br>      
                            The power of memories and expectations are so strong, that for most of us, the past and the future are MORE real than the present. Ever started feeling anxious simply by thinking about something in the future or past?
                        </br>
                        </br>      
                            To make matters worse, it’s difficult to live in the here and now unless the past has been taken care of (resolved) and the future looks bright and promising.
                        </br>
                        </br>     
                            If our “right now” consists largely in review of only memories and expectations, we’re never even aware of the present. And we remain that way even when the things we’ve been looking forward to come and go. 
                        </br>
                        </br>           
                            Sadly, the automatic actions of memory and foresight are often our own worst evolutionary tool, preventing each of us from experiencing life as it’s happening, as it really is. Right now.
                        </br>
                        </br>     
                            Right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  
                            Even if you do find it difficult to recognize your own ability to live in the moment (or not), everyone understands the basic principle of life. Here one moment, gone the next. 
                        </br>
                        </br>     
                            We’ve all experienced tragedy and witnessed the injustices that take place around the world. Nothing is guaranteed and what we have right this moment isn’t just what’s really “happening” (or reality), it’s all we have. 
                        </br>
                        </br>    
                            The past are only memories (not reality). 
                            The future isn’t a guarantee. 
                            What does that leave us with? 
                        </br>
                        </br>     
                            Right now is... life.  
                            If we let go of what was and what we feel should be we’ll find that it’s much easier to enjoy life, right now.
                        </br>
